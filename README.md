**Polkadot AI Agent Kit** is an open-source library designed to build AI Agents that interact with the Polkadot ecosystem. The library provides tools for wallet management, cross-chain transactions, NFT interactions, DeFi integrations, and interactions with Asset Hub and parachains such as People Chain and Kusama Chain. The project will be archived under the **[OpenGuild](https://github.com/openguild-labs)** organization upon completion.
